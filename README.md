## üéØ Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to design and implement an E-Commerce system with separate services. This is a modern, production-ready microservices architecture built with Python FastAPI. This project implements best practices for scalable microservices development, including containerization, API documentation, and comprehensive testing.

- **User Management**: Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Product Catalog**: Manage products, categories, and inventory.
- **Order Processing**: Handle order creation, payment integration, and status tracking.
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Ensure accurate and up-to-date stock levels.

## üéØ Objectives

- `Scalability`: Ensure that each service is independently scalable to accommodate varying workloads, allowing the system to handle spikes in traffic without affecting performance.
- `Resilience`: Design a fault-tolerant system where each service operates independently, minimizing the impact of service failures.
- `Real-Time Data`: Use Kafka for real-time inventory tracking, ensuring product availability is always up-to-date.
- `Monitoring and Observability`: Implement Grafana dashboards for monitoring key metrics, such as response times, error rates, and resource usage.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable and maintainable service separation
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Python 3.8+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication & Authorization**: JWT-based auth system
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated with OpenAPI/Swagger

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses a microservices architecture. Each service operates independently and communicates via RESTful APIs. Below is an overview of the services included:

- **User Service**: Manages user authentication and profile data
- **Product Service**: Handles product catalog and inventory
- **Order Service**: Manages customer orders
- **Payment Service**: Integrates with external payment gateways
- **Notification Service**: Sends email and SMS notifications

All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. The system architecture will use tools such as:

- **Kafka**: Used for event streaming to ensure data consistency and real-time updates.
- **Grafana**: Utilized for monitoring service metrics and ensuring application reliability.
- **Docker**: Enables containerization for seamless development and deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: Provides orchestration for scalability

## üõ†Ô∏è Services

- **User Service**: Registration, login, and JWT-based authentication
- **Product Service**: CRUD operations for products, category management, and inventory tracking
- **Order Service**: Shopping cart, order placement, and order tracking
- **Payment Service**: Payment processing and transaction logs
- **Notification Service**: Real-time email and SMS alerts

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL
- Git

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yusuphwasiu/amazon-replica.git
   cd amazon-replica
   ```
2. Set up environment variables: 
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the variables as needed.
3. Build and start the services using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
4. Access the application:
    API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üñ•Ô∏è Development

- **Install dependencies**:  
  Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Run services locally** :
  Use the development server to start the application:
  ```bash
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```

## üß™ Testing
- **Run the test suite**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **View coverage report**:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=.
  ```

## üåç Deployment

- **Build and push Docker images**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t yourusername/amazon-replica:latest .
  docker push yourusername/amazon-replica:latest
  ```

- **Deploy to your preferred cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)**.

## üìà Monitoring
